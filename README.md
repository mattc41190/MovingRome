# MovingRome
A PoC for a dynamic history website written in javascript using jquery, jquery mobile and the google maps API. 

The app is currently split into two major sections, the main application which is the meat of the project (index.html) 
and the coordinate tool (coordinateTool.html). 

The coordinate tool is segregated in all areas except CSS.

All pages respond to changes made in the main CSS sheet (mainstyle.css)
